Stock Analyzer

The project will use Python and libraries like Pandas, to create a stock analyzer that displays current stock information that the user asks for. The program will take in input from the user and display an output of data in a chart that can compare multiple stock charts.
A complete stock analyzer that calls data from YahooFinance API and displays the data in a visual representation.

To improve program:

1. Find a file that has all ticker symbols. Validate user input so that the ticker they type is one in the file.
2. Add start and end date feature.
